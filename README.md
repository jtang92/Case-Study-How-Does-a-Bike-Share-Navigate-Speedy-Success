# Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success

This github page contains the code, data analysis, and data visualization case study project for the fictional company, Cyclistic.

The [.rmd](https://github.com/jtang92/Case-Study-How-Does-a-Bike-Share-Navigate-Speedy-Success/blob/main/Case%20Study.Rmd) file contains my thought process and the codes when preparing, cleaning, and formatting the data for analysis in RStudio.

Once completed, the data is uploaded to Tableau to create visualizations. Based on the business ask, I have created the following six visualizations:

## Visualization 1 - Average Ride Duration vs. Month of the Year
### We can see that amongst members, the average ride duration of each trip is fairly consistent. Among the casual riders, however, we can see that starting from October up until January, ride duration has decreased, likely due to the poorer/colder weather.

## Visualization 2 - Average Ride Duration vs. Day of the Week
### Both members and casual riders tend to ride the bikes for a longer duration during the weekends, especially on Saturdays and Sundays. For members, the ride duration is very consistent on the weekdays, indicating that some members might be using the bike-share service as a mode of transportion for their daily commute.

## Visualization 3 - Total Rides vs. Day of the Week
### Here, we can see that amongst casual riders, they are more likely to use the bike-share services on the weekends, whereas for existing members, they are more likely to use the bike-share services throughout the weekdays.

## Visualization 4 - Total Rides vs. Month of the Year
### Here we can see the total number of rides broken down by the months of the year. To no surprise, summer time shows the most traffic for bike-share services, likely attributed to the summer holidays and great weather, and vice versa we see a decrease in ridership in the winter.

## Visualization 5 - Total Rides vs. Time of the Day
### Both casual riders and members exhibit a similar trend when looking at the time when the bike-share services are accessed. When we look at the times for our members, we can see further data supporting our earlier hypothesis, that some members might be using the bike-share service as a mode of transportation for their commute to and from work or school, hence the peak at 8:00AM and 5:00PM.

## Visualization 6 - Totaly Rides vs. Types of Bikes
### Finally, we can see that both casual riders and members have a fairly balanced preference when it comes to classic bikes or electric bikes. However, throughout the whole year we can see that there have very few casual riders utilizing the docked bikes, and members not even using the docked bikes.

# So... to warp things up...
#### **1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
Based on our analysis, we can surmise that a good percentage of our annual members that use the bike-share service use it on a daily basis for their means of transportation throughout the day, likely for work or school. Casual riders on the other hand we can see them likely using our services on the weekends for recreational purposes.


#### **2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?**
Casual riders that wish to take advantage of the convenience of the bike-share service would likely consider purchasing a membership. If they are seeking alternative methods of transportation for commuting through the weekday, we can see the benefit for casual riders to upgrade to a membership, allowing them to use the services for both commuting and recreational purposes.


#### **3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to inuence casual riders to become members?**
I would suggest for the Cyclistic social media and research team to promote the healthy benefits of riding a bike, compared to driving to work. We can promote the health benefits, environmental benefits, as well as money-saving benefits members can enjoy by changing their regular methods of transportation.



# My top 3 recommendations for Cyclistic
### 1. As pointed out earlier, the company should research trends on the healthy benefits of riding a bike, as well as the environmental contributions.
### 2. Increase promotion and advertisements during the summer season where there is peak ridership, and consider offering discounts for months in winter to raise profits during the slower season.
### 3. Consider removing docked bikes for all riders, given how unpopular these bikes are. This could potentially save on maintenance costs without harming the clientele.
